# Iridium
Clean, fresh UI with a half-life that'll blow you away. 💍

> **Note**
> The Iridium design language will be planned using Figma, and will strictly adhere to the latest design files linked here.

## Project Motivation
As a company, we want all our products to have consistent, coherent UI. We also want to avoid using any widely-used cookie cutter templates and/or frameworks, and instead design our products in-house.

## Screenshots
There are no screenshots available currently, but we'll add some when they're ready.
